This quantum information package for the <A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>
computer algebra system allows the manipulation of instances
of objects-- operators, vectors, tensors, <I>etc.</I>  that
appear in the theory of quantum information and of quantum
entanglement.  More precisely these objects are typically
represented in this package as row and column vectors and
matrices, whose entries may be explicit numbers (of various
classes) or algebraic expressions. This software occupies a
niche distinct from high performance numerical linear
algebra software as well as software such as the <A NAME="tex2html2"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>
tensor packages that manipulate abstract mathematical
objects.  This document describes the functions and data in
the package and how to use them with <A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>, assuming
that you do not know much about <A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>, but do know
quantum information theory. However, most of the examples
are also found in introductory texts on quantum information.
The package is intended for research and teaching in the
theory of entanglement and quantum information and related
fields.

<P>
Examples of the facilities of the
package are

<UL>
<LI>Methods for constructing pure and mixed states and operators.
</LI>
<LI>Methods for executing standard operations found in
    computational linear algebra as well as the tensor
    product, partial trace, etc.
</LI>
<LI>Functions to compute commonly appearing quantities such as entropy and purity.
</LI>

<P>
This document begins with a very brief introduction to
<A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>emphasizing features that are important for
<I>qinf</I>. The remainder of the manual is a series of small
sections introducing functions with examples. The examples
mostly consist of testing equations. First identities and
textbook exercises are presented, in part because they are
the natural calculations to include in the test suite from
which they are taken. Then more complicated calculations are
tested, as that is the initial application of the author-- to
check manual calculations and results found in other documents.
In this restricted sense, the package can give results on
simple abstract statements: If 1) generic instances of objects are
generated, and 2) a representation-invariant statement is
formulated, and 3) the subexpressions are successfully coerced
into some canonical form, then defects in the statement can
sometimes be detected if the statement is not true.

<P>
Some suggestions and things to be aware of in the following sections.

<UL>
<LI>You probably need to read at least a ten minute
  <I>Maxima</I> tutorial before or in conjunction with
  reading this document. There are several listed at the
  <A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>website, and others that a search engine can
  find. If you are too impatient there is a very brief
  introduction to <A NAME="tex2html7"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>below. The best source for
  most questions is the <A NAME="tex2html8"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/docs/manual/en/maxima.html"><I>Maxima</I> manual</A>.
</LI>
<LI>There are several user interfaces to <A NAME="tex2html9"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>. All the
    examples here are generated using the 
    <A NAME="tex2html10"
  HREF="http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/imaxima/Site/Welcome.html"><I>imaxima</I></A>
<A NAME="4425"></A> package
    for the <I>emacs</I><A NAME="4428"></A> editor/environment, but the results are
    similar to other graphical frontends to <A NAME="tex2html11"
  HREF="http://maxima.sourceforge.net/"><I>Maxima</I> </A>. Other popular graphical
    frontends are <A NAME="tex2html12"
  HREF="http://wxmaxima.sourceforge.net"><I>wxmaxima</I></A><A NAME="4437"></A>,
    and <A NAME="tex2html13"
  HREF="http://www.texmacs.org/"><I>texmacs</I></A>.<A NAME="4443"></A>
</LI>
<LI>Most functions currently work only with qubits, others for variable number of
    states.

<P>
Some of the ideas used in <I>qinf</I> are inspired by the package 
<A NAME="tex2html14"
  HREF="http://www.pitt.edu/~tabakin/QDENSITY/"><I>qdensity</I></A>
written for a proprietary symbolic algebra system. None of
the code in qdensity has been borrowed for this project,
however. Advice on <I>Maxima</I> and <I>lisp</I>
programming was provided by, among others, Robert Dodier,
Stavros Macrakis, and Barton Willis.
