qinf.tex is the latex documentation source. It can be
processed into pdf, ps, or html.

* For html try this file for the initializattion file
dot.latex2html-init.  See NOTES-latex2html.

* several tex packages, extra fonts, etc. are needed for
building the docs.

hhktotex.pl is used to make man_index.tex. Then the first
entries full of illegal symbols man_index.tex are removed
by hand.
