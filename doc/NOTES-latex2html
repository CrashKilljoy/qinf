#  some options to try -white -antialias -image_type gif

* the font_size above makes the math a little bigger

* using \begin{item} \end{item} did not work.
  had to use \item instead. so this works for
  both latex and latex2html

* if ifx then else
  none are understood by latex2html, so they
  wont work

* \begin{htmlonly} etc.
  not understood by latex. fails. adding
  \usepackage{html} does this help??
  in any case   \usepackage{html} breaks latex
  understanding  \index

* now o  \usepackage{html} seems necessary for latex to work.
  however this is broken...
  \begin{latexonly}
   \newcommand{\bbm}{\vspace{5pt}\par\noindent\begin{boxedminipage}{1.05\linewidth}}
  \end{latexonly}
  says bbm is undefined. must comment it out

  instead use this...

  \newcommand{\bbm}{\vspace{5pt}\par\noindent\begin{boxedminipage}{1.05\linewidth}}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \renewcommand{\bbm}{\vspace{5pt}\par\noindent\begin{boxedminipage}{2.0\linewidth}}
  \end{htmlonly}

  No, the above is broken too. latex2html fails to renew the command properly. cant
  understand linewidth. latex2html can handle this...

  % \newcommand{\bbm}{\vspace{5pt}\par\noindent\begin{boxedminipage}{1.05\linewidth}}
  \begin{htmlonly}
    \renewcommand{\bbm}{\vspace{5pt}\par\noindent\begin{boxedminipage}{2.0\linewidth}}
  \end{htmlonly}

   but this breaks latex, of course

  this is really fucked. it looks like i have to comment things out every time
  i want to build something else.

  OMFG it looks like the following works for both html and latex
  \html{ \renewcommand{\bbm}{\vspace{5pt}\par\noindent\begin{boxedminipage}{2.0\linewidth}} }
  \latex{  \newcommand{\bbm}{\vspace{5pt}\par\noindent\begin{boxedminipage}{1.05\linewidth}} }

* ~/.latex2html-init file

$MATH_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.8;
$DISP_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.0;
$FIGURE_SCALE_FACTOR = 1.6;
$EXTRA_IMAGE_SCALE = 1.0; # seems to have no effect
$DVIPSOPT = ' -Ppdf  -E'; # this is default
#$DVIPSOPT = ''; # makes some images huge
$WHITE_BACKGROUND = 1;
#   $STYLESHEET = "../realsimple.css";
1;

# the following lines got rid of grey backgrounds on some equations

# Force white background and black text
$BODYTEXT = "text=\"\#000000\" bgcolor=\"\#FFFFFF\"";
# This ensures that some figures do not end up with a grey background
$WHITE_BACKGROUND = 1;
# Tell LATEX:
$LATEX_COLOR = "\\pagecolor{white}";

* changed one character in /usr/bin/pstoimg , but it did not get rid of
  grey background
