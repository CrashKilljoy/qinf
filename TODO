* change toproj to 'proj'

* examine float vs rational problems with the different entropies. They
  can probably be handled uniformly. It is probably the log2 function that
  is forcing things to be rational in von Neumann entropy.

* following is the line used to write lisp translations of the functions to a file. they
  are used as a starting point to rewrite the functions in lisp

* rotate computational bases to put bipartite system in schmidt form

Partially Done
--------------
* entropy and other functions that compute eigenvalues
  do not handle floating point numbers. They convert them
  to rationals. this is wrong behavior. Note, it might
  be log2. the renyi works ok.

Done
--------------
* bell operators
* hadamard operator
* werner states
* GHZ state
* alpha-Renyi entropy
* Change z-axis to 'computational basis'
* In documentation the big measurement line in the
 entanglement swapping does not appear in latex  form,
  only qinf form !
